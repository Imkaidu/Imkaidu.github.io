<p>I started teaching in 2013 when I was a PhD candidate at the University of Adelaide (UOA), as a tutor and tutor coordinator for the course of <em>Intermediate Econometrics</em>. My training and most of my teaching practice have been related to microeconomics and micro-econometrics (K1). I have delivered ‘core’ courses for students in the field of economics and business, such as Quantitative Methods (CORPFIN7033) for the UOA Business School (288 undergraduate/postgraduate students) and Elements of Econometrics (ECON7310) for the UQ School of Economics (230 postgraduate students). I have also delivered elective courses of these programs, such as Wealth Management in China for the UOA Business School (50 postgraduate students) and China: Emergence, Implications &amp; Challenges (235 undergraduate students) for the UQ School of Economics. Moreover, I delivered an industry-focused workshop in 2014 (two hours and around 200 attendants) for the Small and Medium Enterprises Bureau in Tianjin, China.</p>
<p>While redefining the concept of being a university academic, Boyer (1990) emphasised the importance of teaching as scholarship. Teaching economics requires discipline-related teaching expertise, or what Shulman (1987) called ‘pedagogical content knowledge’. My ambition is to grow my discipline-related teaching expertise through developing knowledge of effective economics-specific pedagogical practice (V1 and V4). Learning in economics is an iterative process reliant on applying complex economic principles, so I use all available opportunities to involve my students in discussion and encourage them to share their knowledge with their peers, as suggested by Greenlaw (2006). I encourage my students to ‘think like an economist’ (Allgood et al., 2015), ‘not to hear about it, or to read about it, but to do it’, as Greenlaw (2006, p. xii) argued.</p>
<p>I view each student who comes to the classroom as an intelligent and able individual with a life story and unique experiences that can support the learning of everyone in the class, including myself. My mission is to guide my students and help them develop an in-depth understanding of the subject matter and its application in real life. My role is akin to a guide who provides resources and support, rather than a ‘sage on the stage’ who treats students as content consumers. It is challenging at times, but it also brings me joy as I attempt to create learning opportunities that support individual students (V2). I find that the attendance rate is highest whenever students show curiosity about the topic. So, I encourage students’ curiosity on economic principles and give them opportunities to apply their thinking to the issues they are interested in. To do this, I draw on a range of authentic economic-specific situations in my classes that students can connect with. In the classroom, I use examples from daily life. This strategy facilitates learning and encourages students to think like economists. Through reflection on my practices as both an economist and a teacher of economics, I aim to instil a ‘thinking like an economist’ ethos in my teaching.</p>
