<p>I started teaching in 2013 when I was a PhD candidate at the
University of Adelaide (UOA), as a tutor and tutor coordinator for the
course of <em>Intermediate Econometrics</em>. My training and most of my
teaching practice have been related to microeconomics and
micro-econometrics. I have delivered ‘core’ courses for students in the
field of economics and business, such as Quantitative Methods
(CORPFIN7033) for the UOA Business School (288
undergraduate/postgraduate students) and Elements of Econometrics
(ECON7310) for the UQ School of Economics (230 postgraduate students). I
have also delivered elective courses of these programs, such as Wealth
Management in China for the UOA Business School (50 postgraduate
students) and China: Emergence, Implications &amp; Challenges (235
undergraduate students) for the UQ School of Economics. Moreover, I
delivered an industry-focused workshop in 2014 (two hours and around 200
attendants) for the Small and Medium Enterprises Bureau in Tianjin,
China.</p>
<p>While redefining the concept of being a university academic, Boyer
(1990) emphasised the importance of teaching as scholarship. Teaching
economics requires discipline-related teaching expertise, or what
Shulman (1987) called ‘pedagogical content knowledge’. My ambition is to
grow my discipline-related teaching expertise through developing
knowledge of effective economics-specific pedagogical practice. Learning
in economics is an iterative process reliant on applying complex
economic principles, so I use all available opportunities to involve my
students in discussion and encourage them to share their knowledge with
their peers, as suggested by Greenlaw (2006). I encourage my students to
‘think like an economist’ (Allgood et al., 2015), ‘not to hear about it,
or to read about it, but to do it’, as Greenlaw (2006) argued.</p>
<p>I view each student who comes to the classroom as an intelligent and
able individual with a life story and unique experiences that can
support the learning of everyone in the class, including myself. My
mission is to guide my students and help them develop an in-depth
understanding of the subject matter and its application in real life. My
role is akin to a guide who provides resources and support, rather than
a ‘sage on the stage’ who treats students as content consumers. It is
challenging at times, but it also brings me joy as I attempt to create
learning opportunities that support individual students. I find that the
attendance rate is highest whenever students show curiosity about the
topic. So, I encourage students’ curiosity on economic principles and
give them opportunities to apply their thinking to the issues they are
interested in. To do this, I draw on a range of authentic
economic-specific situations in my classes that students can connect
with. In the classroom, I use examples from daily life. This strategy
facilitates learning and encourages students to think like economists.
Through reflection on my practices as both an economist and a teacher of
economics, I aim to instil a ‘thinking like an economist’ ethos in my
teaching.</p>
