<h2 class="allowframebreaks" id="discrete-systems">Discrete systems</h2>
<p>For any physical system, we have two main questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What laws are there for a particular type of system?</li>
<li>What are the rules for the allowable laws?</li>
</ol>
<p>Consider a <strong>coin</strong>. It has two
states/configurations/values: heads or tails. If we put a coin on a
table, its initial condition is either heads or tails, and our law of
motion is that it <strong>stays the same</strong>. In other words, at
any point in time, we have that</p>
<p><span class="math display">H \to H, \quad T \to T.</span></p>
<figure>
<img src="figures/2020-07-21-21-22-07.png" style="width:25.0%"
alt="Staying the same." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Staying the same.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But we could also construct a system where the law of motion is that
at any point of time, the coin <strong>switches</strong>; that is,</p>
<p><span class="math display">H \to T, \quad T \to H.</span></p>
<figure>
<img src="figures/2020-07-21-21-22-19.png" style="width:20.0%"
alt="Switching." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Switching.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can define a function <span class="math inline">\sigma(t)</span>
that tells us about the side of the coin at the next point in time <span
class="math inline">t+1</span> given some time <span
class="math inline">t</span> (for our cases, we can assume that <span
class="math inline">t \in \mathbb Z</span>). We have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\sigma(t) = \begin{cases} 1 &amp;
\text{heads} \\ 0 &amp; \text{tails} \end{cases}</span></p>
<p>We can define our first law of motion, the one where we had the coin
staying still, with the equation <span class="math inline">\sigma(t+1) =
\sigma(t)</span>. Similarly, we can express our second law of motion,
the one where the coin switches at every time interval, as <span
class="math inline">\sigma(t+1) = -\sigma(t)</span>. Notice that both
systems are completely deterministic (predictive). If we intervene, then
we are breaking the closed system. In closed systems, laws are entirely
deterministic.</p>
<p>Now consider a <strong>die</strong>. It has a set of configurations
<span class="math inline">\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}</span>. We could express any
laws of motion we come up with as a graph, such as</p>
<figure>

alt="Dice laws of motion." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Dice laws of motion.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once again, these laws are completely deterministic. We could also
consider</p>
<figure>
<img src="figures/2020-07-21-21-15-49.png" style="width:30.0%"
alt="Dice laws of motion." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Dice laws of motion.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is logically equivalent to the above; just relabel the numbers.
But one could devise something like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="figures/2020-07-21-21-16-22.png" style="width:30.0%"
alt="Dice laws of motion." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Dice laws of motion.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This is <strong>not</strong> logically equivalent, because if you are
in one cycle you won’t get to the other one. This is called a
<strong>conserved quantity</strong>, and its law is a conservation law.
We can put states <span class="math inline">1,2,3</span> into some group
A, and states <span class="math inline">4,5,6</span> into some group B.
If we are in group A, we stay in group A. Similarly, if we are in group
B, we stay in group B.</p>
<p>We can also consider</p>
<figure>
<img src="figures/2020-07-21-21-19-43.png" style="width:30.0%"
alt="Dice laws of motion." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Dice laws of motion.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If we let group A <span class="math inline">=\{1\}</span>, group B
<span class="math inline">=\{2,3\}</span> and group C <span
class="math inline">=\{4,5,6\}</span>, we can also see that these are
conserved quantities.</p>
<p>We can now consider some infinite line, where each point is <span
class="math inline">\in \mathbb Z</span>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="figures/2020-07-21-21-28-06.png" style="width:80.0%"
alt="An infinite number of states." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">An infinite number of
states.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A particle has an infinite number of states <span
class="math inline">\in \mathbb Z</span>. We could invent laws such
as:</p>
<ul>
<li>wherever we are, move one unit;</li>
<li>wherever we are, move two units (in fact, in this instance, we have
a conserved quantity: oddness and evenness!);</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above rules are <strong>allowable laws</strong>. But not
all laws are legal. Which are not allowable? Consider a 3-sided coin
which can land on its edge, for argument’s sake.</p>
<figure>
<img src="figures/2020-07-21-21-30-57.png" style="width:30.0%"
alt="“E” means edge." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">“E” means edge.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We have a situation of</p>
<p><span class="math display">H\to T\to E\to T\to E\cdots, \quad T\to
E\to T\to E\cdots, E\to T\to E\to T\cdots,</span></p>
<p>so we can predict into the future…but we <strong>cannot</strong>
predict into the past. This means that this is
<strong>non-reversible</strong>. How do we check reversibility? Just try
reversing each arrow.</p>
<figure>
<img src="figures/2020-07-21-21-31-53.png" style="width:30.0%"
alt="Reversing…nope." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Reversing…nope.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now we have two arrows coming out of one state? Where do we go? We
don’t know, so this is not deterministic. This sort of law is not
allowed in <em>classical</em> physics.</p>
<p>If we know the initial conditions perfectly, you could predict the
future and the past. Otherwise, we would like to quantify how much we
can predict. For example, weather forecasters can reasonably predict the
weather for 3 days from now, but since the atmosphere is a chaotic
system, we might no longer be able to after a few days. The laws of
classical mechanics are deterministic into the future and the past.</p>
<p>How does one determine predictibility concretely? It’s simple:
<strong>one input, one output arrow</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s finally get into some real world physics: <strong>point
particles in space</strong>. What are the configuraions of a point
particle?</p>
<h2 class="allowframebreaks" id="super-basic-math-review">Super basic
math review</h2>
<p>Let’s look at the standard Cartesian coordinate system in 3
dimensions.</p>
<figure>
<img src="figures/2020-07-21-21-37-14.png" style="width:35.0%"
alt="Cartesian coordinate system." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Cartesian coordinate system.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A point is labelled with coordinates <span
class="math inline">(x,y,z)</span>. The standard direction of the <span
class="math inline">z</span> is determined by the right-hand-rule.</p>
<p>A <strong>vector</strong> has both length and direction. Example:
position of point relative to origin (but origin-independent).
Typically, vectors are denoted <span class="math inline">\vec v</span>.
The length is denoted <span class="math inline">|\vec v|</span>, and the
direction is harder to write down. We can define the vector as well by
connecting each coordinate to the basis vectors:</p>
<figure>
<img src="figures/2020-07-21-21-38-32.png" style="width:35.0%"
alt="Coordinates." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Coordinates.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For our cases, we denote the components <span
class="math inline">v_x, v_y, v_z</span>.</p>
<p>We now look at some basic facts about the algebra of vectors. If
<span class="math inline">c \in \mathbb R</span>, then <span
class="math inline">c \vec A</span> is the vector <span
class="math inline">\vec A</span>, but <span
class="math inline">c</span> times as long. If we take <span
class="math inline">-\vec A</span>, it is <span class="math inline">\vec
A</span> but in the opposite (negative) direction. We can
<strong>add</strong> vectors geometrically:</p>

alt="Adding vectors." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Adding vectors.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>or algebraically by summing the components,</p>
<p><span class="math display">C_x = A_x + B_x \quad \implies \quad C_i =
A_i + B_i, \quad \forall i.</span></p>
<p>Can we multiply vectors? Yes, in two main different ways. Can we
divide vectors? Uhh…not really well defined. We’ll look at the dot
product method of multiplying vectors.</p>
<figure>
<img src="figures/2020-07-21-21-41-07.png" style="width:35.0%"
alt="Dot product visually" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Dot product visually</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The <strong>dot product</strong> is defined as <span
class="math inline">\vec A \cdot \vec B = |\vec A| |\vec B| \cos
\theta</span>, where <span class="math inline">\theta</span> is the
angle between the vectors. The dot product is commutative; that is,
<span class="math inline">\vec A \cdot \vec B = \vec B \cdot \vec
A</span>. We also have that <span class="math inline">\vec A \cdot \vec
A = |\vec A|^2</span>. We can also use the dot product as a nice way to
compute the angle between two vectors.</p>
<p>Now let us prove the law of cosines.</p>
<figure>

<p><span class="math display">

    \vec C \cdot \vec C &amp;= (\vec A - \vec B) \cdot (\vec A - \vec B)
\\
    &amp;= \vec A \cdot \vec A + \vec B \cdot \vec B - 2(\vec A \cdot
\vec B) \\
    &amp;= |\vec A|^2 + |\vec B|^2 - 2 |\vec A||\vec B|\cos \theta_{\vec
A \vec B}
\end{aligned}
</span></p>
<h2 class="allowframebreaks" id="particle-motion">Particle motion</h2>
<p>Consider a particle with vector denoted by <span
class="math inline">\vec r</span> and coordinates <span
class="math inline">x,y,z</span>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="figures/2020-07-21-21-53-10.png" style="width:30.0%"
alt="Particle." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Particle.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We are generally interested in the motion of particles. The three
equations</p>
<p><span class="math display">\vec r_x(t) = x(t), \quad \vec r_y(t) =
y(t), \quad \vec r_z(t) = z(t)</span></p>
<p>summarise the motion of the particle. We also know that the velocity
is the derivative of the particle, so we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">v_x = \frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm dt} r_x =
\left(\frac{\mathrm dx}{\mathrm dt}, \frac{\mathrm dy}{\mathrm dt},
\frac{\mathrm dz}{\mathrm dt}\right).</span></p>
<p>We can use Newton’s notation</p>
<p><span class="math display">\frac{\mathrm df(t)}{\mathrm dt} = \dot
f(t), \quad v_i = \frac{\mathrm dx_i}{\mathrm dt} = \dot x_i.</span></p>
<p>We also have that acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.
Acceleration also has direction, so we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">a_i = \frac{\mathrm d^2 x_i}{\mathrm dt^2}
= \ddot x_i = \dot v_i.</span></p>
<p>We can also write</p>
<p><span class="math display">\vec v = \frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm dt} \vec
r = \dot{\vec r}, \quad \vec a = \frac{\mathrm d^2}{\mathrm dt^2} \vec r
= \ddot{\vec r}.</span></p>
<p>Now consider simple motion along a line. We have</p>

alt="Motion along a line." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Motion along a line.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Suppose that <span class="math inline">x(t) = a+bt+ct^2</span>. We
then have that <span class="math inline">v(t) = \dot x = b + 2ct</span>,
and <span class="math inline">a = \ddot x = 2c</span>.</p>
<p>We can also look at circular motion on the unit circle.</p>
<figure>
<img src="figures/2020-07-21-22-03-11.png" style="width:30.0%"
alt="Circular motion on the unit circle." />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Circular motion on the unit
circle.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Angle increases with respect to time with rule <span
class="math inline">\theta = \omega t</span>. How long does it take to
go from <span class="math inline">0</span> to <span
class="math inline">2\pi</span>? We can obtain this by solving <span
class="math inline">2\pi = \omega t</span>, which implies</p>
<p><span class="math display">t = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} =
\mathrm{period}.</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\omega</span> is called the angular
frequency. Parametrising the unit circle, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">x = \cos \omega t, \quad y = \sin \omega
t</span></p>
<p>and therefore</p>
<p><span class="math display">v_x = -\omega \sin(\omega t), \quad v_y =
\omega \cos(\omega t).</span></p>
<p>What is the angle between position and velocity? Intuitively,
perpendicular, but we can compute this explicitly using the dot
product.</p>
<p><span class="math display">x \cdot v_x + y \cdot v_y = -\omega \sin
\omega t \cos \omega t + \omega \sin \omega t \cos \omega t =
0</span></p>
<p>therefore the two vectors are orthogonal. For acceleration and
position, we can perform a similar calculation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">a_x = -\omega^2 \cos (\omega t) ,\quad a_y
= -\omega^2 \sin (\omega t).</span></p>
<p>Note that acceleration is parallel to the position vector, but is
inwards (as is the case with centrifugal acceleration).</p>
